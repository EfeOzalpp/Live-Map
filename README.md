# 📍 Live Map Project

## 🗺️ Scenario

Imagine landing in a new city, exciting, disorienting and perhaps slightly intimidating. 
This app provides, a real, unfiltered overview of the city's vibe, based on what others upload on the city, to their geolocation at the time.
Expect to find, interesting moments, restaurants promoting their food, city landmarks, beautiful sunsets, and some quirkier photos (nonetheless real).

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Live Map offers a **crowd-sourced pulse of a place**, helping people feel connected and informed in unfamiliar spaces.
